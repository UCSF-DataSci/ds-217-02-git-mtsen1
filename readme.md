## Information from Assignment 1

1. My GitHub username is mtsen1
2. Answer: 233168
3. My name is Muyun and I received my Bachelor's in Global Disease Biology at UC Davis and am now pursuing a Master's in Health Data Science here at UCSF. My last research project at UC Davis involved working with image data of fruits and I want to be able to continue working with similar data but in the healthcare field. I used Python to work on my past projects, but I never learned the foundations of Python which limited what I could do. So, in this course, I am mainly looking to learn the basics and practice using Python.
